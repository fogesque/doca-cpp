# RDMA Client-Server Specification Prototype

# Description:
# Each endpoint represents what buffers must be created 
# on both Client and Server sides to make RDMA operation
# run by Client request.
# RDMA operations supported: Send, Receive, Write, Read

# Endpoint represents an information of which RDMA operation
# will be registered. Server submits Receive task to get Request,
# Client submits Send task to send Request.

# Request includes Endpoint information which will be parsed by
# Server. So, in these terms Endpoint is message structure that 
# defines what RDMA operation to perform.

# Endpoint Fileds Description:

# Endpoint Path: 
# The path is unique identificator to concrete resource (RDMA buffer)
# and is like URI. There can be several endpoints with the same path
# to perform different operations with same buffer between 
# Client and Server

# Endpoint Type:
# Endpoint type represent which operation
# SEND:     Client send a message to remote Server
# RECEIVE:  Client requests a message from remote Server
# WRITE:    Client writes to remote Server buffer
# READ:     Client reads from remote Server buffer

# Endpoint Buffer:
# Section that provides RDMA buffer informaton, such as its size in bytes.
